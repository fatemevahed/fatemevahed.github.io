Sarah said fearfully:" Oh my gosh! Can we come back please?!"

Julia said:" Well, we passed the invisible layer and we can't come back! Not yet... So guys, I think it's better to..."

Tom crossed his arms and said:" You can't be the leader and tell us what to do! I'm the leader, so I can control you."

Julia said groaning:" But I was the first person who discovered everything!"

Tom said smirking:" What does it have to do with? I'm the boss because I'm the strongest student."

—Ahh, fine...You know what? That's actually better as I don't need to take whole these students' responsibility!

Tom said:" So at first we have to find a safe place!... Like a safe place to camp in."

The students walked in the forest, causing the grass under their foot to rustle.  
Julia beheld the towered trees that were enveloped with algae, so close to each other. 
Suddenly her eyes settled on a tree house upside a tree. 
Julia said ecstatically:" Look up, everyone! There's a tree house! We can stay there!" 

Everyone stared at the tree house.

Tom said:" Well... It's nice but... What if some people are already living there?!... Peter? Can you come with me? We have to check there to make sure that nobody else is there."

Peter, Tom's best friend, said:" Okay."

Julia said pleadingly:" Can I come there too?"

Tom said:" Umm... I'm not sure... But if you wanna come, come. I suggest you not to come though. Anyway, since I don't wanna have another argument... So, you can come."

Julia said gladly:" Oh thanks!"

Tom shaked his head and smirked, then they clambered up the tree together. 

When they arrived up there, they found themselves standing on a wide, sturdy branch.
The tree house was made of wood and the ivy flowers and algae had grown on the walls, so that the house seemed really old and mysterious. 
Tom opened the door, cautiously and they peered inside the house.
The light, coming from the dirty windows, had lit up the wooden floor. There was a small kitchen in the left side of the house and another parts of the house were full of chairs, book shelves and also a table. 
The motes of dust had scattered in the light, as if they were some lost ashes. 

Tom said:" Well... It's a good house and the capacity is enough for us."

Peter said:" Yeah... But this house definitely has an owner. They might be back anytime...I assume defeating the dark devil takes a little long time, we can't stay here, like, for good." 

Julia said:" Well, according to my knowledge of dark devil that I learnt from that book, unfortunately, defeating the dark devil takes more than one day." 

Tom asked curiously:" Why then?!" 
— It's obvious. He's really... You know...Die-hard and well... Defeating him isn't that easy peasy.... So we have to get done with some tasks at first and then defeating him will be easier. 

Tom sighed and said:" It's okay... Anyway, we always have to be ready for anything!"

Then he cried out from there:" It's safe! Come here!" 

When everyone came there one by one, Tom said:" So, guys! We're going to stay here for now. Next step is... Well... I'm not sure..."

Julia disrupted him:" The guide book says that we have to find a magical tree which is the tallest tree in this forest. The leaves of the tree are purple actually but one of them is dark blue and we should cut out the dark blue leave. Then we should take that leave to dark devil's castle and break the curse of the invisible layer by using the sap of that leave."

Tom looked at her shockingly, with an open mouth. 
—Oh...That's quite a...An adventure. But how can I trust the book you discovered?!" 

Julia rolled her eyes and said:" Do you mean you can't trust it because I found it?! Right?! But if you had found it, you would have trusted it. 
— Um... Wait... Can I ask a question?! Why do you always relate everything to each other?

Julia snapped:" I don't know and I don't care… But can I ask a question too? What's your solution for defeating the dark devil, if you don't trust the book?"

Tom sighed and said reluctantly:" So we have to find that tree at first."
Then he went to a window in the left side of the house and gazed outside.

—I saw the tree... It's there... But unfortunately it's a little far." 

Julia observed the forest out there and saw a purple tree showing up in the horizon, among lots of trees. 

Julia said smiling:" This is gonna be so exciting." 

Tom said grinning:" Don't worry, you're not going to have adventures so much. Because you girls are gonna stay here and we, the boys, will do everything, I'll also take the book with myself."

Julia blinked and said defiantly:" You must be kidding, right?."

Tom looked away and said playfully:" Nope."

—You're so naughty, Tom! We're not weak!

Tom drawled:" I never said you're weak... It's just for your own safety."

Julia said raising an eyebrow:" I didn't know you care about my safety."

Tom's cheeks suddenly turned red. 
—Wha...

Julia said sharply, determined:" Anyway, I'm going to come with you! I came here to have some adventures not sitting on a chair! And I'm not weak! I'm even stronger than you!" 

Tom sighed again and said:" Alright! Since you insist, you can come. But you shouldn't make trouble and argue with me!" 
Suddenly a black and round fume appeared in the middle of the house and turned around itself. 

Tom said shockingly:" What's this?!"

The fume said with a female, yet thick voice:" Who are you?! Who are you?!" 

Julia said:" W...we wanna defeat the dark devil!" 

The fume chuckled:" You?! Really?! Are you kidding me?! How can some little children defeat dark devil?! Probably you can defeat the goblins but the dark devil... Ah... Nobody can defeat him!"

Tom said fiercely:" But... I don't think it's hard.. And I should add that we're not little children!" 
—Okay! Okay! Let me come to you! Then we'll talk easier!
