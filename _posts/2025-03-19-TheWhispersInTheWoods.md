The girl looked at the lake. But it was different. It had a really shiny dark blue color. It seemed that some white stars had fallen into it. 
From the darkness among the trees, a female voice cried out, “Help me! Help me, Julia!”
She should have done something...
- Julia!
Somebody was calling her name.
- Julia! Wake up! 
She opened her eyes...It was just a nightmare? She looked at Martha who was looking at her with her green eyes. The sun had lighted a part of Martha's curly brown hair.
- Sorry, I was exhausted.
Then she took a glance at the forest that could be seen from the window. 
The ground in front of the forest had dressed up as a massive green prairie while many trees had grown up there that the fall breeze was making their leaves dance.

Sarah, sitting in front of the two girls, touched her ginger hair and said:" It's definitely because of your excitement. You always get excited for everything." 
Then she looked at the window with her blue eyes and said:" I'm so excited too. But forests…Freak me out sometimes.”
Martha chuckled and said:" Oh, Sarah! You're scared of everything! Not just forest!"
Sarah rolled her eyes and said:" No, that's not true at all! I'm scared of nothing but forests, especially the dark forests!"

The teacher, who was standing next to the driver, straightened her short curly blond hair and said:" We've arrived guys!"

Then the bus stopped and the students got off the bus, one by one. 
Julia jumped on the green grass, trying to feel the velvet grass. 
Then she said to the teacher:" Oh, Mrs. Willer! I love school camps! Especially science camps!"
-Yeah, that's nice! When I was 13, I loved school camps too!"
Tom, the boy who had just got off the bus, ran a hand through his curly brown hair arrogantly and said:" We're not here to play. We've camped to learn science!"

His harassment began again. Why did he have to bother Julia all the time? Probably because he had always been her competitor. 
Julia sighed and said:" Tom! I think you shouldn't taunt! That's right, I didn't study on our camping trip last year, but you shouldn't remind me of this!"
Tom said smirking:” You’d better be grateful that I'm pointing out your mistakes, despite being your competitor.”
Julia couldn't help but look daggers at him and look away. 
As the breeze caressed her face, she put her hands in the pockets of her blue coat and looked around, until her eyes stopped on the forest. 
The trees were so close that the space among them looked a little dark, but still…It was like something wanted to jump out of the forest to give you a goosebump. It seemed silent there, but the darkness had many words to say, words that probably indicated the existence of a creature in the forest. 
“ Why does the forest make me feel…Weird?” Julia thought. 
She sighed and said:” Nevermind.” 
Then she organized her blond hair that was braided in two tails and said excitedly to Mrs. Willer:" Wow! Are we really going to stay here for one week?!...I can't believe it! I love forests so much!"
Mrs. Willer smiled and said:" Sorry sweetie, but we can't go inside the forest so much. It might be dangerous there. But don't worry. After teaching you something, I'll check the forest out.”
Julia said pleadingly:" Can't I come with you?"
- Sorry darling but no, you can't."
Julia sighed and sat on a rock. 
When Mrs. Willer taught them how to camp and do other tasks, she said:" Well, guys! I'm going to check the forest. Please don't follow me!... Tom? Can you write any of the students' names who came to the forest?!"
Tom smiled and said proudly:" Sure thing, Mrs. Willer!"
“ How arrogant!” Julia thought as she looked at Tom. 

Then Mrs. Willer went to the forest. But as Julia looked at her, Mrs. Willer suddenly stopped and looked around and after a few seconds she entered the forest.

Julia sighed again. She wanted to go to the forest so badly and as she stared deep into the dark, she felt something pushing her towards the forest…It wasn’t an object but she could feel it, as if it was a magnet. She also knew that she mustn't have gone to the forest but then...she took a few steps to the forest.
“ What am I doing? I…I shouldn't do this!...Wha…” 
Suddenly she felt that she heard Martha's voice:" Julia?! Where are you going?!... Don't go!...Don't you know that Tom writes the names of any students who go to the forest? Do you wanna get a negative mark?”

“ Did Martha just say something to me?...Not a big deal…I should go to the forest.”
She took more steps and said out loud:” I'm coming, forest! I'm coming!"
When Martha found out Julia didn't listen to her, shouted:"Julia!"
Suddenly Julia came to herself. She was only four steps away from the forest.
 Then she said confusedly:" Oh... Wha... What happened...What has happened Martha?"
- Do you know what you're doing?!
- Well... I was just going to the forest…Like unconsciously, I guess?...I don't know…I knew that I must've not done this..But I did it..A feeling told me to do this...And now I feel weird. Now that I'm watching the forest again, I feel that I really wanna go there... Yeah, I'm coming, forest!"
Suddenly Martha took her hand and said:" The forest is dangerous, Julia!"

The girls saw Tom coming to them, all of a sudden.
 His gray eyes shined for a moment as he said:" I saw you coming from the forest. Did you go to the forest?!"
Martha said:" No, we didn't!"
Julia said:” We never break the rules, Tom!” 
Tom smirked as usual and said:” Really? That's a new thing, because as far as I remember, you always broke the rules, Julia.” 
Well, that was almost true. Julia couldn't help but make some troubles at school, she just didn't like getting bored. 
 One hour later, the students gathered together, as Mrs Willer hadn't come back yet. 
A guy asked Tom:"  Why doesn't Mrs. Willer come?!"
Tom said:" How should I know?... Let's wait a little more.”

Julia looked at the forest again. Suddenly she heard a female voice like the voice in her nightmare:" Come! Come to me! Come here and save me! You'll experience an eternal peace here! Come! Come and save me!"

Not everyday would it happen for people to hear a sharp creepy voice from a forest. But still Julia heard it. And yet, she couldn't believe it. 
But then, Julia felt that magnet again and heard the voice which was repeating the same words.
She covered her ears and closed her black eyes.
“ What the hell is going on?”
After a few seconds, she opened her eyes and didn't cover her ears anymore. 
Sarah said worriedly:" Julia?! you okay?!"
Julia looked at them and said:” Did you hear that voice too? The voice that came from the forest?”
Tom said confusedly:" No, of course not… Don't worry, You probably heard it because you believe in mumbo jumbo!"
Julia said:" They're not mumbo jumbo! You think that they are!” 
Tom said:" Should I really prove to you that they're mumbo jumbo?"
Julia said madly:" No, you can't! Besides ,I've gotten used to these arguments with you! And these arguments are really boring for me!"

Or were they actually boring? Because she felt like those arguments with Tom made her eager to go to school. 

It was the middle of night but Mrs. Willer hadn't come back.
Whole the students gathered near a fire near their tent.
Tom said:" Some of us should look for Mrs. Willer. I wanna go."
Julia said:" Well... I think it's dangerous but... I wanna look for Mrs. Willer too!"
Tom said:" Unfortunately, you can't come. You're not as strong as us, because you're a girl.”
Julia said:" I don't think such things need strength! Whether I'm a girl or a boy, I can handle the dangers of the forest!"
Tom said:" So, what if a wolf or bear or another wild animals attacked us?"
- That's right that I'm not able to kill them but are you?!
- We have guns!
- Really?!... But can't I work with gun?
- Well, I don't think that you're interested in killing.
- Well, of course I'm not!...So... How about running away from the wild animals?
- That's a really silly idea!
- Do you mean that I'm stupid?!
- When did I say that?
- I think you meant that I'm stupid, Tom!
- So, what's the matter with it?
- Because I really don't like to be stupid! If I am, I have to change myself. But in my opinion, I'm not stupid.
- Nobody likes to be stupid! Look, Julia! I recommend you not to come. At least, don't come so that you won't die.
- I prefer to endanger my life but also see the forest and have some adventures!
- Sorry, but no, you can't come.
- Yes, of course I can.
- No.
- Yes!
Martha said angrily:" Ah! Tom! Julia! Please don't argue like that! Argument doesn't solve our problems! Can you stop these childish and silly arguments?! You're not a kid anymore, are you?"
Julia stood up and said:" Alright! What if nobody goes to the forest? Probably Mrs. Willer will come now."
A girl who was touching her long black hair as usual said:" How do you know that?"
- Well... I don't know, Clara... But I think it's better to wait. Maybe she'll come tomorrow."

The silence took over the prairie as they did not say anything. The only thing that could be heard was the squeaking of crickets in the bushes. 
Julia looked at the fire in front of her. The orange and red flames of the fire broke the darkness and danced.
After a while, when it was time to sleep, the boys went to their own tent and the girls went to their own.
Two hours passed. But Julia was still awake.
That forest... How could it talk? It was impossible, although in Julia's opinion, nothing was impossible. 
Did Mrs. Willer's disappearance have anything to do with that weird forest? Or even that nightmare?
Julia couldn't put up with her odd feeling.
So, she weard her blue coat on her red sleepwear and picked up her flashlight from her backpack. Then she exited the tent.
Julia looked around anxiously. But everyone was in their tents, and she could only see the dark prairie. 
 Then she went near the forest with her flashlight.
She watched inside the forest. It was dark as usual but who knew how many secrets had hidden there? 
Julia stopped watching there, as not to hear the voice.
Then a part of the ground that was lit up by her flashlight, drove her attention. That part didn't have much grass and was red. 
Julia leaned over it and saw the green algae that had grown on the red stuff and the dirt had taken over it. 
Julia touched it and looked at her finger and saw dust. 
It must have been there for a really long time.
She put her flashlight on the ground and tried to put up the stuff. 
“ Why is this so heavy? Oh God…I can't…”
Finally she managed to put it up and looked at it carefully. 
Julia said confusedly:” What is this?...Wait…Is this a book? What is a book doing on a prairie?”
Julia went back to the tent with her flashlight and the book, taking her steps rapidly. 
As she sat on her sleeping bag, she shook the dirt on the book and read the title of the red book while using her flashlight:

"The guide of the cursed forest"

Julia was shocked again. She opened the book. The index had written in the first page of book but there wasn't any name of the writer.
She read the second page:
> Chapter 1: The story of the cursed forest
> I wanna talk to you about a forest. If you wanna save the forest, you have to know its story, at first.
> Everything started when the dark devil was born. Before that, this forest was amazing and  magical of course! Whole the magical and also normal creatures in this forest had a great life. Until the dark devil, who is the main devil's relative, noticed the existence of this magical forest.
> Via some research, he discovered that the forest had a power that brings an endless peace to life and all your wishes will be fulfilled in that forest. The dark devil wanted to not only take over the whole world but also that magical forest. If he managed to do so, he could steal the power of the forest with a little effort and then take over the whole world with that power.
> He took over the forest causing it to be really dangerous.
> He figured out that stealing that power is really hard, so he cursed the forest, so that if anyone goes there, they can never exit the forest, unless that person breaks the curse. Then he put some dangerous and magical creatures in the forest.
> That curse is actually an invisible layer that is in two steps away from the forest. The dark devil wanted to make taking over the world easier, so he cursed the forest again. This new curse causes the forest to attract imaginative people who believe in many of the fairy tales.
> Due to this curse, these people unconsciously go to the forest and if they go inside the forest, they will never exit. Well, attracting realistic people was hard, so the dark devil didn't tell the forest to attract them. Besides, if those imaginative people can overcome that attracting feeling, in the third time of attracting, they'll hear a voice coming from the forest which says:" Come! Come to me! Come here and save me! You'll experience eternal peace here! Come! Come and save me!"
When Julia read this part, she got more shocked. 
“ That's why I heard those words!” 
Julia kept on reading more excitedly:
> Fortunately, the dark devil hasn't been able to steal the power of the forest. Not yet. But he's making hard efforts. 
> If you wanna save the whole world and the forest, you'd better use this book. Also, you have to go through the forest and break the curse and save everyone. But remember that if you go over that invisible layer, you will never be able to exit there, until that time when you break the curse.
> This was the whole story. But don't worry! I'll guide you in this book!"

Julia smiled gladly and she was so eager to read more, so she spent almost a half of the night reading the book. She read chapter 2 and also chapter 3. Now, she knew many things about the forest, which nobody else knew.
“ I should go to the forest and save everyone! But I hope that this work will be over within a week. Or else, I won't be able to come back home and our families will be worried about their children…” 
Then she sighed and thought:” But I suppose my family won’t be worried about me. They're not my real family after all.” 
Her neighbors couldn't care less about her, could they? They never liked her parents and it was always a mystery for Julia. 
She thought about her parents’ mysterious death for a moment, that occured when she was 4. The day that their house caught fire all of a sudden and her parents’ corpses were found outside of the house, was still clear to Julia. 
Julia finished reading chapter 3 and put it in her backpack. 
Tomorrow was the time. The time for saving the whole world and the forest...
