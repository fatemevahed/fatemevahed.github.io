The girl looked at the lake. But it was different. It had a really shiny dark blue color. It seemed that some white stars had fallen into it. 

From the darkness among the trees, a female voice cried out, “Help me! Help me, Julia!”

She should have done something...

**— Julia!**
Somebody was calling her name.

**— Julia! Wake up!**
She opened her eyes...It was just a nightmare? She looked at Martha who was looking at her with her green eyes. The sun had lighted a part of Martha's curly brown hair.

**— Sorry, I was exhausted.**  
Then she took a glance at the forest visible from the window. The ground in front of the forest had dressed up as a massive green prairie while many trees had grown up there that the fall breeze was making their leaves dance.

Sarah, sitting in front of the two girls, touched her ginger hair and said: **“It’s definitely because of your excitement. You always get excited about everything.”**  
Then she looked at the window with her blue eyes and said: **“I'm excited too. But forests... they freak me out sometimes.”**

Martha chuckled and said: **“Oh, Sarah! You’re scared of everything, not just forests!”**

Sarah rolled her eyes and said: **“No, that’s not true at all! I’m scared of nothing but forests, especially dark ones!”**

The teacher, who was standing next to the driver, straightened her short curly blond hair and said: **“We've arrived, guys!”**

Then the bus stopped and the students got off the bus, one by one. Julia jumped on the green grass, trying to feel the velvet texture under her feet. 
**“Oh, Mrs. Willer! I love school camps! Especially science camps!”**

**“Yeah, that's nice! When I was 13, I loved school camps too.”**

Tom, the boy who had just got off the bus, ran a hand through his curly brown hair arrogantly and said: **“We’re not here to play. We came to learn science.”**

His harassment began again. Why did he have to bother Julia all the time? Probably because he had always been her competitor. 

Julia sighed and said: **“Tom, I think you shouldn’t taunt me! It’s true that I didn’t study much on our last camping trip, but you don’t have to keep reminding me!”**

Tom said smirking: **“You should be grateful that I’m pointing out your mistakes, despite being your competitor.”**

Julia couldn't help but glare at him before looking away.

As the breeze caressed her face, she slipped her hands into the pockets of her blue coat and glanced around until her eyes settled on the forest.

The trees stood so close together that the space between them appeared dark, almost menacing. It felt as if something were lurking in the shadows, ready to leap out and send shivers down her spine. The silence was deceptive—within the darkness, unspoken words seemed to echo, hinting at the presence of an unseen creature.

"Why does the forest make me feel... weird?" Julia wondered.

She sighed and muttered, "Never mind."

Then, adjusting her blonde hair—braided into two tails—she turned excitedly to Mrs. Willer.

"Wow! Are we really staying here for a whole week?! I can't believe it! I love forests so much!"

Mrs. Willer smiled and replied, "Sorry, sweetie, but we can't go too deep into the forest. It might be dangerous. But don't worry—once I finish teaching you something, I'll check it out."

Julia pleaded, "Can't I come with you?"

"Sorry, darling, but no. You can't."

Julia sighed and sat on a rock.

After teaching them how to set up camp and complete other tasks, Mrs. Willer announced, "Well, guys! I'm going to check the forest. Please don't follow me!... Tom, can you write down the names of any students who go into the forest?"

Tom grinned and said proudly, "Sure thing, Mrs. Willer!"

"How arrogant," Julia thought as she shot a glance at Tom.

Then Mrs. Willer went to the forest. But as Julia looked at her, Mrs. Willer suddenly stopped and looked around and after a few seconds she entered the forest.

Julia sighed again. She wanted to go into the forest so badly. As she stared deep into the darkness, she felt something pulling her toward it… It wasn’t a physical force, but she could sense it—like a magnet drawing her in.

She knew she wasn’t supposed to go into the forest, yet… she took a few hesitant steps forward.

"What am I doing? I... I shouldn't be doing this!... Wha—"

Suddenly, she heard Martha’s voice.

"Julia?! Where are you going?! Don't go! … Don't you know that Tom writes down the names of any students who enter the forest? Do you want to get a negative mark?"

"Did Martha just say something to me? … Not a big deal… I should go to the forest."

She took a few more steps and called out, "I'm coming, forest! I'm coming!"

When Martha realized Julia wasn’t listening, she shouted, "Julia!"

Suddenly, Julia snapped back to reality. She was only four steps away from the forest.

Confused, she mumbled, "Oh... Wha... What happened? What’s going on, Martha?"

"Do you even know what you're doing?!" Martha asked, her voice laced with concern.

"Well... I was just walking toward the forest... like unconsciously, I guess? I don’t know… I knew I wasn’t supposed to do this, but I did it anyway. Something told me to go… and now I feel strange. Now that I’m looking at the forest again, I feel like I really want to go there… Yeah, I’m coming, forest!"

Before she could take another step, Martha grabbed her hand.

"The forest is dangerous, Julia!"

The girls suddenly saw Tom approaching them.

His gray eyes gleamed for a moment as he said, "I saw you coming from the forest. Did you go in?"

Martha quickly replied, "No, we didn't!"

Julia added, "We never break the rules, Tom!"

Tom smirked, as he always did, and said, "Really? That’s new. Because as far as I remember, you always broke the rules, Julia."

Well, that was almost true. Julia couldn’t help but stir up trouble at school—she just didn’t like being bored.

An hour later, the students gathered together, growing uneasy. Mrs. Willer still hadn’t returned.

A boy turned to Tom and asked, "Why isn't Mrs. Willer back yet?"

Tom shrugged. "How should I know? … Let’s wait a little longer."

Julia looked at the forest again.

Suddenly, she heard a female voice—eerily similar to the one from her nightmare.

"Come! Come to me! Come here and save me! You'll experience eternal peace here! Come! Come and save me!"

It wasn’t every day that someone heard a sharp, creepy voice coming from the forest. And yet, Julia did.

Still, she couldn’t believe it.

Then, that strange pull—the invisible force—returned, stronger than before. The voice repeated its haunting plea.

Julia covered her ears and squeezed her black eyes shut.

"What the hell is going on?"

After a few seconds, she hesitantly opened her eyes and let her hands drop from her ears.

Sarah’s worried voice broke through her daze. "Julia?! Are you okay?!"

Julia turned to them, her voice unsteady. "Did you hear that voice too? The one from the forest?"

Tom frowned. "No, of course not… Don’t worry. You probably imagined it because you believe in all that mumbo jumbo!"

Julia snapped, "It’s not mumbo jumbo! You just think it is!"

Tom smirked. "Should I really prove to you that it’s all nonsense?"

Julia shot back, frustrated, "No, you can’t! And besides, I’ve gotten used to these arguments with you! They’re honestly boring now!"

Or… were they really boring?

Because, deep down, she had to admit—those arguments with Tom were part of what made school exciting.

It was the middle of the night, but Mrs. Willer still hadn’t returned.

All the students gathered around a fire near their tents.

Tom spoke up. "Some of us should go look for Mrs. Willer. I want to go."

Julia hesitated. "Well... I think it’s dangerous, but... I want to look for her too!"

Tom shook his head. "Unfortunately, you can’t come. You’re not as strong as us—because you’re a girl."

Julia frowned. "I don’t think strength has anything to do with this! Whether I’m a girl or a boy, I can handle the dangers of the forest!"

Tom crossed his arms. "Oh yeah? What if a wolf, a bear, or some other wild animal attacks us?"

"Okay, sure, I’m not strong enough to fight them," Julia admitted. "But are you?"

"We have guns!" Tom replied smugly.

"Really?! … And you think I can’t use one?"

Tom smirked. "Well, I don’t think you’re interested in killing."

Julia scoffed. "Of course I’m not! … So, how about just running away from wild animals?"

"That’s a really dumb idea."

Julia narrowed her eyes. "Are you saying I’m stupid?"

"When did I say that?" Tom asked, raising an eyebrow.

"I think you meant it, Tom!"

"So what if I did?" he teased.

"Because I really don’t like being called stupid! If I were, I’d have to change myself. But in my opinion, I’m not stupid."

"Nobody likes being stupid," Tom said with a sigh. "Look, Julia, I’m telling you this for your own good. You shouldn’t come. At least stay back so you don’t get yourself killed."

Julia crossed her arms. "I’d rather risk my life, see the forest, and have an adventure!"

"Sorry, but no. You can’t come."

"Yes, I can!"

"No."

"Yes!"

"No!"

"Yes!"

Martha sighed in frustration. "Ugh! Tom! Julia! Please stop arguing like this! Fighting won’t solve anything! Can you stop these childish, silly arguments? You’re not kids anymore, are you?"

Julia stood up. "Alright! What if nobody goes into the forest? Maybe Mrs. Willer will come back on her own."

A girl, who was absentmindedly twirling her long black hair as usual, raised an eyebrow. "And how do you know that?"

Julia hesitated. "Well... I don’t know, Clara... But I think it’s better to wait. Maybe she’ll come back tomorrow."

The silence overtook the prairie as they all remained silent. The only sound that could be heard was the faint squeaking of crickets in the bushes.

Julia stared at the fire in front of her. The orange and red flames broke through the darkness, dancing and flickering.

After a while, when it was time to sleep, the boys went to their own tent, and the girls to theirs.

Two hours passed, but Julia was still awake.

That forest... How could it talk? It seemed impossible, but then again, Julia thought, nothing was truly impossible.

Did Mrs. Willer’s disappearance have anything to do with that strange forest? Or perhaps even with that nightmare?

Julia couldn’t shake the odd feeling gnawing at her.

Unable to sleep, she threw on her blue coat over her red sleepwear, grabbed her flashlight from her backpack, and stepped out of the tent.

She looked around anxiously, but all was quiet. Everyone else was still in their tents, and she could only see the vast, dark prairie.

She walked toward the forest, flashlight in hand.

As she peered into the forest, the darkness was as thick as ever, but who knew what secrets it hid?

Julia turned away, unwilling to listen to the voice again.

Then, the beam of her flashlight caught something on the ground that drew her attention. The patch of earth was red, with little grass growing over it.

She leaned closer and saw green algae creeping over the red area, the dirt overtaking it.

Julia touched the ground, and when she looked at her finger, it was covered in dust.

It must have been there for a long time.

She placed her flashlight on the ground and tried to move the strange object.

"Why is this so heavy? Oh God… I can’t…”

Finally, she managed to lift it and examined it closely.

"What is this? … Wait… Is this a book? What’s a book doing on the prairie?"

Julia hurried back to the tent, clutching the book in one hand and her flashlight in the other. Her steps quickened.

Once inside the tent, she sat on her sleeping bag, shaking off the dirt from the book. She then read the title, illuminated by the flashlight:

"The Guide of the Cursed Forest"

Julia froze in shock.

She opened the book, and the index was written on the first page, but there was no author’s name.

She flipped to the second page...

> *Everything started when the dark devil was born. Before that, this forest was amazing and  magical of course! Whole the magical and also normal creatures in this forest had a great life. Until the dark devil, who is the main devil's relative, noticed the existence of this magical forest.*
> *Via some research, he discovered that the forest had a power that brings an endless peace to life and all your wishes will be fulfilled in that forest. The dark devil wanted to not only take over the whole world but also that magical forest. If he managed to do so, he could steal the power of the forest with a little effort and then take over the whole world with that power.*
> *He took over the forest causing it to be really dangerous.*
> *He figured out that stealing that power is really hard, so he cursed the forest, so that if anyone goes there, they can never exit the forest, unless that person breaks the curse. Then he put some dangerous and magical creatures in the forest.*
> *That curse is actually an invisible layer that is in two steps away from the forest. The dark devil wanted to make taking over the world easier, so he cursed the forest again. This new curse causes the forest to attract imaginative people who believe in many of the fairy tales.*
> *Due to this curse, these people unconsciously go to the forest and if they go inside the forest, they will never exit. Well, attracting realistic people was hard, so the dark devil didn't tell the forest to attract them. Besides, if those imaginative people can overcome that attracting feeling, in the third time of attracting, they'll hear a voice coming from the forest which says:" Come! Come to me! Come here and save me! You'll experience eternal peace here! Come! Come and save me!"*

Julia froze. 

**“That’s why I heard those words…”**

Julia kept on reading more excitedly:
> *Fortunately, the dark devil hasn't been able to steal the power of the forest. Not yet. But he's making hard efforts. *
> *If you wanna save the whole world and the forest, you'd better use this book. Also, you have to go through the forest and break the curse and save everyone. But remember that if you go over that invisible layer, you will never be able to exit there, until that time when you break the curse.*
> *This was the whole story. But don't worry! I'll guide you in this book!"*

Julia smiled eagerly, her excitement growing as she read on. She spent almost half the night immersed in the book, devouring Chapter 2 and Chapter 3. By the time she was done, she knew many things about the forest that nobody else knew.

"I should go into the forest and save everyone!" she thought. "But I hope this work is finished within a week. Otherwise, I won’t be able to go back home, and our families will start to worry about their children..."

She sighed and added, "But I suppose my family won’t be worried about me. They're not really my family, after all."

Her neighbors never cared about her, did they? They never liked her parents, and it had always been a mystery to Julia why.

She briefly thought about her parents’ mysterious death when she was only four. The day their house caught fire without warning, and her parents' bodies were found outside, was still vivid in her mind.

Julia finished reading Chapter 3 and tucked the book into her backpack.

Tomorrow was the day—the day to save the world and the forest...
