Everyone woke up, as the sun began to show up. But, Julia had already waken up. 
Julia braided her hair in two tails, as usual, put on her clothes, put up her red backpack that had that weird book in it and exited the tent. 

Julia glared at the forest, being aware of everything that had happened, this time. 

Julia muttered : “Alright! I'm coming the cursed forest!”
Suddenly a calm wind blew from the forest.
She took a few steps and when she was three steps away, she stood still.
She was hesitant. Was that a good decision at all?
Martha's shocked voice took her back to reality:" Do you really wanna go to the forest again?!"

 —Yes, I do. But that has a special reason. I wanna save the whole world and this forest. If you like, you can come and help me. Of course, I don't think I can manage anything by myself."

Martha said smiling:" Oh, Julie! Nobody is in danger! Why do you make danger for everyone just because you daydream?"

—Look! The dark devil is alive and we have to defeat him!
Suddenly another calm wind from forest blew and the students came there.
Martha, confused, said:" Wha..."
Tom interrupted:" Are you going to the forest?... So I'll write your names."
Martha sighed and said:" Where's the point when there's no teacher to see that stupid paper?!"
—Well...What if she comes back?
Julia smiled and said:" Look Tom! Actually we're going to the forest to rescue the forest and the world... and also Mrs Willer. You can help us too."
Tom scoffed:" Are we in danger?" 
Julia shot him a glare and snapped:" Yes, we are! The dark devil wants to rule over the world!"
Sarah said shockingly:" The dark devil?!"
—Yeah. He's one of the main devil's relatives who has taken over this forest in order to steal the magic inside it.

Martha said raising an eyebrow:" How exactly do you know these stuff?"
— The things I'm saying aren't based on my imagination. This book gave me this information. 
 She showed the book.
Sarah asked curiously:" Where did you get that book?!"

As everyone listened to Julia's explanation, their eyes widened. 
Tom asked:" How do you know the book is telling the truth? Perhaps the author lied to you. Or maybe... It has been written for fun."

Julia glared at him, thinking why he always disagrees with everything she says:" I'm going to the forest anyway. If you don't want, you don't have to come. But I think you'd better know the story."

Then she told them everything about the dark devil and the forest and also the invisible layer.
Then she passed the layer that felt like a soft wall. 
Now, she was two steps away from the forest.
When Julia took one another step excitedly, Martha passed the layer and took Julia's hand. She suddenly raised an eyebrow and said with a shaky voice:" 
Oh my god!... What was that?!"
Julia said smiling:" You passed that invisible layer that I told you about and well... You felt it!"
—What?!.... But... That's... Absurd!
—I told you the truth, Mar Mar.
Sarah passed the layer as well and said excitedly:" Julia's right, guys! That book isn't fake!... Also the magic exists!"

Everyone passed the layer but Tom.
mission?!"
Everyone raised their hands, except Tom who confronted Julia's creepy glare, so that he said reluctantly:" I'll come too because I have nothing better to do."

And then with their hearts pounding, the students ventured into the forest, knowing that the fate of the world rested on their shoulders.
